# Android-Developer-Challenge-Scholarship
This is my repository for the *Developer Challenge Scholarship* by Google and Udacity on the *Android Developer Track*.

The `master` branch contains all the lesson exercises, the `sunshine` branch contains all the exercises on the actual _Sunshine Weather App_.
