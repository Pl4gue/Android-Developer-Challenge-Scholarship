### Android Developer Challenge Scholarship
This is my repository for the *Developer Challenge Scholarship* by Google and Udacity on the *Android Developer Track*.

The `master` branch contains all the lesson exercises, the `sunshine` branch contains all the exercises on the actual _Sunshine Weather App_. 

#### _NOTE_

The first 3 lessons aren't covered by commits here as I set up the git repository in the fifth lesson(fourth lesson in exercises, fifth in Udacity Course).
